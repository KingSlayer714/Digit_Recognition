# Digit_Recognition
This project involves building a machine learning model to recognize and classify handwritten digits from the well-known MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each representing a handwritten digit (0-9) in a 28x28 pixel grayscale format.
